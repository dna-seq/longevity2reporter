# longevity2reporter

Longevity2 reporter (pre alpha version) displays your genome analysis related to longevity and disease risks. It is a part of [Oakvar-Longevity](https://github.com/dna-seq/oakvar-longevity) module.

It consists now of 5 parts:

- Longevitymap report, show your longevity-related rsid and their influence.
- Cancer report, show cancer risks.
- Drug report, show how your genome influences drug effects.
- Coronary disease report, lists snps that influence on chances to have coronary disease.
- PRS report, have polygenic risk scores.

Each of the parts of the report is created from the data that was generated by a corresponding postaggregator ([just_longevitymap](https://github.com/dna-seq/just_longevitymap), [just_cancer](https://github.com/dna-seq/just_cancer), [just_drugs](https://github.com/dna-seq/just_drugs), [just_coronary](https://github.com/dna-seq/just_coronary), [just_cardio](https://github.com/dna-seq/just_cardio), [just_prs](https://github.com/dna-seq/just_prs), [just_lipidmetabolism](https://github.com/dna-seq/just_lipidmetabolism) and [just_thrombophilia](https://github.com/dna-seq/just_thrombophilia) postaggregators)
